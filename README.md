## ACFA: Secure Runtime Auditing and Guaranteed Device Healing via Active Control Flow Attestation

Low-end embedded devices are increasingly used in a wide range of ``smart'' applications and spaces. They are implemented under strict cost and energy budgets, using microcontroller units (MCUs) that lack  security features akin to those available in general-purpose processors.
In this context, Remote Attestation (RA) was proposed as an inexpensive security service that enables a verifier (Vrf) to remotely detect illegal modifications to the software binary installed on a low-end prover MCU (Prv). Despite its effectiveness to validate Prv binary integrity, attacks that hijack the software's control flow (potentially leading to privilege escalation or code reuse attacks) cannot be detected by classic RA.

Control Flow Attestation (CFA)
augments RA with information about the exact order in which instructions in the binary are executed. As such, CFA enables detection of the aforementioned control flow attacks.
However, we observe that current CFA architectures can not guarantee that Vrf ever receives control flow reports in case of attacks. In turn, while they support detection of exploits, they provide no means to pinpoint the exploit origin. Furthermore, existing CFA requires either (1) binary instrumentation, incurring significant runtime overhead and code size increase; or (2) relatively expensive hardware support, such as hash engines. In addition, current techniques are neither continuous (they are only meant to attest small and self-contained operations) nor active (once compromises are detected, they offer no secure means to remotely remediate the problem).

To jointly address these challenges, we propose ACFA: a hybrid (hardware/software) architecture for Active CFA. ACFA enables continuous monitoring of all control flow transfers in the MCU and does not require binary instrumentation. It also leverages the recently proposed concept of ``active roots-of-trust'' to enable secure auditing of vulnerability sources and guaranteed remediation, in case of compromise detection.

This github repository provides an open-source reference implementation of ACFA on top of a commodity low-end MCU (TI MSP430) and evaluate it to demonstrate its security and cost-effectiveness.

## Video Demo

[A video demonstration of ACFA is avilable here](https://github.com/AnonymousAuthors729/ACFA/tree/main/video)


## Dependencies Installation

Environment (processor and OS) used for development and verification:
Intel i7-3770
Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS

Dependencies on Ubuntu:

                sudo apt-get install bison pkg-config gawk clang flex gcc-msp430 iverilog tcl-dev

## Building Software
To generate the Microcontroller program memory configuration containing VRASED trusted software (SW-Att) and sample applications we are going to use the Makefile inside the scripts directory:

        cd scripts

To build the test-case:

        make demo

Note that this step will not run any simulation, but simply generate the MSP430 binaries corresponding to the test-case of choice.
As a result of the build, two files pmem.mem and smem.mem should be created inside msp_bin directory.

In the next steps, during synthesis, these files will be loaded to the MSP430 memory when we either: deploy ACFA on the FPGA or run ACFA simulation using VIVADO simulation tools.

If you want to clean the built files run:

        make clean

        Note: Latest Build tested using msp430-gcc (GCC) 4.6.3 2012-03-01

To test ACFA with a different application you will need to repeat these steps to generate the new "pmem.mem" file and re-run synthesis.

## Creating an ACFA project on Vivado and Running Synthesis

This is an example of how to synthesize and prototype ACFA using Basys3 FPGA and XILINX Vivado v2019.2 (64-bit) IDE for Linux

- Vivado IDE is available to download at: https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html

- Basys3 Reference/Documentation is available at: https://reference.digilentinc.com/basys3/refmanual

#### Creating a Vivado Project for ACFA

1 - Clone this repository;

2 - Follow the steps in [Building ACFA Software](#building-ACFA-software) to generate .mem files for the application of your choice.

2- Start Vivado. On the upper left select: File -> New Project

3- Follow the wizard, select a project name and location. In project type, select RTL Project and click Next.

4- In the "Add Sources" window, select Add Files and add all .v and .mem files contained in the following directories of this reposiroty:

        /acfa_hw
        /msp_bin
        /openmsp430/fpga
        /openmsp430/msp_core
        /openmsp430/msp_memory
        /openmsp430/msp_periph
       
and select Next.

Note that /msp_bin contains the pmem.mem and smem.mem binaries, generated in step [Building ACFA Software].

5- In the "Add Constraints" window, select add files and add the file

        openmsp430/contraints_fpga/Basys-3-Master.xdc

and select Next.

        Note: this file needs to be modified accordingly if you are running ACFA in a different FPGA.

6- In the "Default Part" window select "Boards", search for Basys3, select it, and click Next.

        Note: if you don't see Basys3 as an option you may need to download Basys3 to your Vivado installation.

7- Select "Finish". This will conclude the creation of a Vivado Project for ACFA.

Now we need to configure the project for systhesis.

8- In the PROJECT MANAGER "Sources" window, search for openMSP430_fpga (openMSP430_fpga.v) file, right click it and select "Set as Top".
This will make openMSP430_fpga.v the top module in the project hierarchy. Now its name should appear in bold letters.

9- In the same "Sources" window, search for openMSP430_defines.v file, right click it and select Set File Type and, from the dropdown menu select "Verilog Header".

Now we are ready to synthesize openmsp430 with ACFA hardware the following step might take several minutes.

10- On the left menu of the PROJECT MANAGER click "Run Synthesis", select execution parameters (e.g, number of CPUs used for synthesis) according to your PC's capabilities.

11- If synthesis succeeds, you will be prompted with the next step to "Run Implementation". You *do not* to "Run Implementation" if you only want simulate ACFA.
"Run implementation" is only necessary if your purpose is to deploy ACFA on an FPGA.

If you want to deploy ACFA on an FPGA, continue following the instructions on [Deploying ACFA on Basys3 FPGA].

If you want to simulate ACFA using VIVADO sim-tools, continue following the instructions on [Running ACFA on Vivado Simulation Tools].

## Running ACFA on Vivado Simulation Tools

After completing the steps 1-10 in [Creating a Vivado Project for ACFA]:

1- In Vivado, click "Add Sources" (Alt-A), then select "Add or create simulation sources", click "Add Files", and select everything inside openmsp430/simulation.

2- Now, navigate "Sources" window in Vivado. Search for "tb_openMSP430_fpga", and *In "Simulation Sources" tab*, right-click "tb_openMSP430_fpga.v" and set its file type as top module.

3- In "tb_openMSP430_fpga", lines 193-196 open the file that each CFLog slice is written to. If you would prefer the `*.cflog` files are written in a specific directory, update these lines with the prefered path. Otherwise, they will be written to `{your vivado project dir}/{your vivado project name}.sim/sim_1/behav/xsim/`

4- Go back to Vivado window and in the "Flow Navigator" tab (on the left-most part of Vivado's window), click "Run Simulation", then "Run Behavioral Simulation".

5- On the newly opened simulation window, select a time span for your simulation to run (see times for each default test-case below) and the press "Shift+F2" to run.

6- Check the directory in Step 3 for the `*.cflog` files.

## Generate Bitstream

1- After Step 10 in [Creating a Vivado Project for ACFA], select "Run Implementation" and wait until this process completes (typically takes around 1 hour).

2- If implementation succeeds, you will be prompted with another window, select option "Generate Bitstream" in this window. This will generate the bitstream that is used to step up the FPGA according to VRASED hardware and software.

# ACFA Demo

The end-to-end demo showcases software that is vulnerable to buffer overflow, and demonstrates how ACFA generates periodic reports and allows for control flow auditing. During the demo, the vulnerable software and location of the exploit is determined momentarily after it has occurred, allowing Vrf to make a choice about remediation before allowing Prv to continue executing. 

In `demo_prv/main.c`, a buffer named `user_input` represents a stream of data read from input. In addition, Prv main software is unaware of the data. It compares this data to the buffer "pass" which contains a password. Prv software reads the stream by continuously saving the data until it receives a return char (`'\r'`). After this, it compares the user input to the password. If the password 

The entire end-to-end demo can be found in two directories: demo_prv and demo_vrf. The demo can be executed by either 'executing' in the Vivado simulator OR implementing ACFA on the Basys3 FPGA, generating a bitstream, and uploading to the FPGA. 

## Setup Angr

The ACFA demo makes use of Angr as a tool for binary analysis in the implementation of the verifier. Visit Angr official site for detailed instructions on installation: https://docs.angr.io/introductory-errata/install 

In addition, ACFA demo makes use of the msp430 extension for Angr found here:
https://github.com/angr/angr-platforms/tree/master/angr_platforms/msp430

## Run Demo

### Vrf - Offline Phase

1- First, compile the expected demo application software. To do so, enter the `scripts` directory and execute `make demo`

2- Next, run the offline phase. To do so, `cd` into `demo_vrf` and execute the python script `symbolic_exec.py`. Several output files will be created and referenced by Verifier during the online phase.

### Prv - Setup and compile Prv software

1- Select which version of the software to execute in `demo_prv/main.c`: non-attack scenario or buffer-overflow exploit. Define `user_input` using line 35 for the non-attack scenario, and use line '38' for the buffer-overflow exploit. Make sure to only have one of these lines active at a time by commenting-out the other.

2- There are two versions of the TCB -- for vivado simulation and for the demo implementation. To select the implementation version, open the TCB source in `tcb/wrapper.c`. Edit line 87 to the following:
        `#define IS_SIM  NOTSIM`

3- `cd` into `scripts` directory and execute `make demo`. Read the console output to ensure there are no errors.

### Synthesis, Implement, and Generate Bitstream

1- Follow the previous steps to Synthesis ACFA modules in Vivado

2- Follow the previous steps to Generate Bitstream.

### Verifier Online phase

1- Determine the serial port that is being utilized by the FPGA board on your computer. In ubuntu, verify the port using the command `dmesg`. For Windows, verify the port in device manager. Then, update the variable `dev` in the file `demo_vrf/serialConfig.py` with the port information.

2- To start the Verifier, `cd` into `demo_vrf` and run the python script in `serialComms.py`

3- You should see in the demo begin in the terminal, and it waits for the Prover.

### Start the Prover

1- In Vivado, upload the bitstream to the FPGA. As soon as it is uploaded, execution will begin. Select "Open Hardware Manager", connect the FPGA to you computer's USB port and click "Auto-Connect". Your FPGA should be now displayed on the hardware manager menu. Right-click your FPGA and select "Program Device" to program the FPGA.

2- After clicking "Program Device", the FPGA will have the design of the ACFA, and will start executing the software. The terminal will update with results of the protocol.

## Demo Result
By running the version of the application that causes a buffer-overflow, anomalies will be detected and reported in the console. In the case of the buffer overflow example, The buffer overflow is detected at line 6 in `1.cflog`. More characters were read than expected, causing the loop of `read_data()` to execute eight times. In addition, the effect of the buffer overflow is seen at the next anamoly in line 9. The function `waitForPassword()` should return before the if statement (addr `0xe058`), but because of the buffer overflow the function returned to the 'Grant-Access condition' (addr `0xe06c`) without comparing the contents of `user_input` to `pass`.

For extra output produced during the protocol, such as contents of the CFLog slices, the MAC-s, etc, view the contents of the log file `prot.log` in the `demo_vrf` directory
